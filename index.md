This github pages website contains a html rendering of the Agda code I have produced as part of my 40 credit MSci Computer Science project: Formalising Real Number Computation and Real Analysis.

An Agda file which indexes the relevant files for my project [can be seen here](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/AndrewIndex).

Here are direct links to each file listed in the Agda Index.

The following five files did not receive any major revision since my last project.

- [MoreNaturalProperties](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/MoreNaturalProperties.html)
- [NaturalsOrderExtended](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/NaturalsOrderExtended.html)
- [NaturalsMultiplication](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/NaturalsMultiplication.html)
- [NaturalsDivision](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/NaturalsDivision.html)
- [HCF](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/HCF.html)

- [IntegersB](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/IntegersB.html)

The remainder of the files are either brand new, or changed by adding new proofs, reformatting, and modularising the files into a more ordered structure. As part of this project I redefined ordered of integers to be more conducive to nice proofs in the Dedekind reals proofs, meaning any proofs involving order of integers/rationals had to be reformulated with the new definition.

The rationals files in particular have been modularised, a large amount of new proofs added, existing proofs reformulated to be cleaner.

Work on the Dedekind reals are in the following files. DedekindRealsProperties proves that the reals are arithmetically located.

- [DedekindReals](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/DedekindReals.html)
- [DedekindRealsAddition](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/DedekindRealsAddition.html)
- [DedekindRealsProperties](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/DedekindRealsProperties.html)
- [DedekindRealsOrder](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/DedekindRealsOrder.html)

These files prove that the rationals are a metric space, and that the Dedekind reals are a complete metric space.

- [MetricSpaceAltDef](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/MetricSpaceAltDef.html)
- [MetricSpaceRationals](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/MetricSpaceRationals.html)
- [MetricSpaceDedekindReals](https://adsneap.github.io/Reals/MetricSpaceDedekindReals.html)

This work in progress file defines continuity, proves that that embedding from rationals to reals is continuous, proves that composition of continuous functions are continuous.

This file may be seen as an example of what one of my "scratch pad" files looks like, where I experiment with proof ideas I am working towards before the file is cleaned.
