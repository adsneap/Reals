Using an alternative definition than the standard, I have proved that the Rationals are a Metric Space with respect to the usual metric.

Next on the list is proving that the Dedekind Reals are a metric space, with respect to an metric equivalent to the standard metric. In order to prove this, I need to finish the proof that the reals are arithmetically located, which requires me to work on some proofs regarding sequences and series.

Following this, I need to prove that my metric space definitions are indeed equivalent to the standard definitions, and go on to prove the continuous extension theorem.

Following this, I will be able to define the standard operations for the reals, and show that the reals equipped with these operation form a complete field.
