\section{Background}

I am a fourth year student undertaking a Masters project. I also completed a project in my third year: \url{https://adsneap.github.io/CSProject}.

This project builds on my third year project, where I learned how to implement mathematical proofs in Agda. The secondary goal, which unfortunately was not achieved due to time constraints, was to show that the Dedekind Reals are a Dedekind-Complete Archimedean Ordered Field. I defined the Dedekind Reals, by first constructing the Integers and Rationals, but did not progress any further. Both projects are built on top of Martin Escardo's Type Topology library \cite{TypeTopology}.

This library is written in the dependently type programming language Agda. Similarly to Coq and Lean, Agda may be used as a proof assistant, however for my work I prefer to view it as a tool for proof verification. When building a library, certainly many of the initial proofs may be auto-solved by Agda, but in my experience asking Agda to look for a proof results in an indefinite hang due to the size of the terms I am working with. If Agda compiles the code, then I can sure that the proofs I am writing is correct up to the interpretation of the types I write, but I cannot rely on Agda to auto-generate proofs for me.
