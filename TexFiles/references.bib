@incollection{dybjer_intuitionistic_2020,
	abstract = {Intuitionistic type theory (also constructive type theory orMartin-L{\"o}f type theory) is a formal logical system and philosophicalfoundation for constructive mathematics. It is afull-scale system which aims to play a similar role for constructivemathematics as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory does forclassical mathematics. It is based on the propositions-as-typesprinciple and clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretationof intuitionistic logic. It extends this interpretation to the moregeneral setting of intuitionistic type theory and thus provides ageneral conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but alsoof what a constructive mathematical object is. The main idea is thatmathematical concepts such as elements, sets and functions areexplained in terms of concepts from programming such as datastructures, data types and programs. This article describes the formalsystem of intuitionistic type theory and its semantic foundations., In this entry, we first give an overview of the most importantaspects of intuitionistic type theory---a kind of ``extendedabstract''. It is meant for a reader who is already somewhatfamiliar with the theory. Section 2 on the other hand, is meant for areader who is new to intuitionistic type theory but familiar withtraditional logic, including propositional and predicate logic,arithmetic, and set theory. Here we informally introduce severalaspects which distinguishes intuitionistic type theory from thesetraditional theories. In Section 3 we present a basic version of thetheory, close to Martin-L{\"o}f's first published version from1972. The reader who was intrigued by the informality of Section 2will now see in detail how the theory is built up. Section 4 thenpresents a number of important extensions of the basic theory. Inparticular, it emphasizes the central role of inductive (andinductive-recursive) definitions. Section 5 introduces the underlyingphilosophical ideas including the theory of meaning developed byMartin-L{\"o}f. While Section 5 is about philosophy and foundations,Section 6 gives an overview of mathematical models of the theory. InSection 7 finally, we describe several important variations of thecore Martin-L{\"o}f ``intensional'' theory described inSection 3 and 4.},

@misc{noauthor_archimedean_2022,
	abstract = {In abstract algebra and analysis, the Archimedean property, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse, is a property held by some algebraic structures, such as ordered or normed groups, and fields. 
The property, typically construed, states that given two positive numbers x and y, there is an integer n so that nx {\textgreater} y. It also means that the set of natural numbers is not bounded above. Roughly speaking, it is the property of having no infinitely large or infinitely small elements. 
It was Otto Stolz who gave the axiom of Archimedes its name because it appears as Axiom V of Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder.The notion arose from the theory of magnitudes of Ancient Greece; it still plays an important role in modern mathematics such as David Hilbert's axioms for geometry, and the theories of ordered groups, ordered fields, and local fields.
An algebraic structure in which any two non-zero elements are comparable, in the sense that neither of them is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is said to be Archimedean. 
A structure which has a pair of non-zero elements, one of which is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is said to be non-Archimedean. 
For example, a linearly ordered group that is Archimedean is an Archimedean group.
This can be made precise in various contexts with slightly different formulations. 
For example, in the context of ordered fields, one has the axiom of Archimedes which formulates this property, where the field of real numbers is Archimedean, but that of rational functions in real coefficients is not.},
