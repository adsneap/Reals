# Reals

This repository contains code that is developing towards a constructive library of Dedekind Reals.

The files are built on top of TypeTopology library, with a view towards integration when the code is cleaned up and finished.

A list of the files that I have developed as part of this project can be found in AgdaCode/AndrewIndex.lagda
