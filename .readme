I am working towards proving that the Reals are a Complete Ordered Field. In order to implement multiplication (and hopefully get all the nice results from the Rationals), I am working on operations from the rationals may be extended to the reals, using a result that continuous functions of a metric space may be extended to a complete metric space. Hence, I am also working on proving that theorem. But this requires the the Dedekind reals are a complete metric space. I have proved that the Dedekind reals a metric space (with an alternative definition to the standard definition), so I am now working on proving that the metric space of the Dedekind Reals is complete. This means proving that any Cauchy sequence in the Dedekind reals converges to a limit. To do this, I am following the method described by the HoTT book.
